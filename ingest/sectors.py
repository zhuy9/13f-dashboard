"""SIC code to sector mapping.

SIC is what the SEC assigns; GICS is what the finance world means by "sector". They do not line
up, and no free crosswalk exists, so this table is the bridge. `reconcile_sectors.py` scores it
against GICS using the S&P 500 as the answer key -- run it after any edit here.

The table follows SIC's own hierarchy, so it is read most-specific-first, like the code itself:

    3571  industry       (4 digits)  Electronic Computers
    357   industry group (3 digits)  Computer & Office Equipment
    35    major group    (2 digits)  Industrial Machinery & Equipment

Put an entry at the coarsest level that is right. A 4-digit exception should exist only because
GICS says so and the measurement backs it -- each one below names the companies that justify it.

Considered and rejected as the source: the SEC's own `ownerOrg` ("06 Technology"), which comes
free in the same submissions response. It has 9 buckets for 11 GICS sectors and they are not
clean -- "04 Manufacturing" is 30% Industrials, 27% Technology, 20% Consumer Staples. Measured
over the same S&P 500 names it caps out near 51%, against 84.7% for this table.
